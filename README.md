# Movie Recommender System
This project leverages a mixture of collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and matrix factorization to provide personalized movie recommendations. 

## Overview
The Movie Recommender System uses a hybrid approach combining:

* **Collaborative Filtering**: This technique recommends movies based on user behavior patterns and preferences. It utilizes matrix factorization to learn latent factors from user-item interactions, such as movie ratings, to predict a userâ€™s potential interest in unseen movies.
* **Content-Based Filtering**: This approach recommends movies based on the features of the movies themselves (e.g., genre, director, cast) and the user's profile or past preferences. By analyzing the content features, the system can suggest similar movies to those the user has liked in the past.
  
By integrating both collaborative and content-based filtering techniques, the system provides more accurate and diverse recommendations.
